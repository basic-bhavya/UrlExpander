2. The URL will be expanded just like the previous method

**Note. The 2nd method would take longer than the first one**

# Issues

1. If same link appears more than once on the page, all corresponding links would be replaced
2. May take longer time for longer web pages or web pages with a lot of links
3. Underlying api has a limit of 100 expansions per hour
